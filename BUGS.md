# BUGS.md

Every bug caught by the simulator, the crash-consistency rig, or differential testing gets an entry
here. This file is the proof behind the verification claim: it is the difference between "we ran a
lot of tests" and "we can show you what the tests found and why they found it."

**Rules**

1. Every bug found by a checker gets an entry. No exceptions for embarrassing ones — especially not
   for embarrassing ones.
2. Every entry must be reproducible: a seed (at the commit that contained the bug) **and** a plan
   bundle in `seeds/` (reproducible at any commit).
3. Every entry must answer **"which mutant class would have caught this?"** If none would have, a new
   mutant is added to `sim/toy/mutants` **in the same PR as the fix** — not as a follow-up.
   *(CLAUDE.md Amendment A2.)*
4. A bug that a checker did *not* catch — found by inspection, by a real-mode run, or by luck — is
   the most valuable entry in the file. It must additionally record what checker was missing and
   whether one was added.

**Counts:** 0 entries (engine bugs; the fenced harness-defect section below is counted separately and does not satisfy this gate). *(A0 is in progress; the phase gate for A1 requires this file to be nonempty,
because a harness that finds nothing is a harness that is too weak.)*

### BUG-NNN — <one-line symptom, in the voice of what an operator would see>

| field | value |
|---|---|
| **Found by** | sim / crash rig / differential / real-mode chaos / inspection |
| **Phase** | A1 |
| **Reproduce (seed)** | `simctl replay 8834127` at commit `<sha>` |
| **Reproduce (plan)** | `simctl run --plan seeds/BUG-NNN/plan.json` (any commit) |
| **Invariant that caught it** | e.g. Election Safety |
| **Mutant class** | e.g. `M2-ack-before-replicate`; or "none existed — added `M8-…` in this PR" |
| **Fix commit** | `<sha>` |
| **Minimized?** | yes — N fault entries, M ops, K nodes |

**Symptom.** What the checker reported, verbatim where possible.

**Root cause.** The actual mechanism, not the patch. Written so someone who has never seen this code
can follow it.

**Why the checkers caught it here and not earlier.** Which injector had to fire, in what order.

**What this would have caused in production.** Be concrete and be honest: silent data loss, a stalled
range, a lost acknowledged write, a duplicated transfer. If the answer is "nothing user-visible," say
that.

**Fix.** What changed and why that is the right fix rather than a narrower one that would also make
the seed pass.

## Harness and lane defects

**This section is not the entry list above and does not substitute for it.** Entries here are defects
in *checkers* — lanes, rigs, mutation harnesses — found by other checkers. They are recorded because
rule 1 says every bug a checker finds gets an entry and makes no exception for embarrassing ones, and
they are fenced off because they are not engine bugs:

- they do **not** count toward the A1 phase gate's "BUGS.md is nonempty" requirement, which is about
  the simulator finding bugs in the *protocol*;
- they do **not** count toward the `[K] documented postmortems` figure in CLAUDE.md's resume lines,
  which is about faults injected into a running system;
- they **do** count as evidence that the induced-failure discipline works, which is the only reason
  either of these was visible at all.

Counts: 2 entries.

### HARNESS-001 — a mutation lane's scratch copy silently lost three files of the tree under test

| field | value |
|---|---|
| **Found by** | `make cpp-mutants`, its own baseline gate |
| **Phase** | B1.0 |
| **Reproduce** | n/a — not seed-driven. `tar cf - --exclude=./.github .` from the repo root, then count files under `third_party/googletest/.github` in the result: 0, not 3 |
| **Invariant that caught it** | vendored-tree integrity (DESIGN-B1 §9.2) — the hash check ran *inside* the scratch copy and disagreed with the recorded hash |
| **Mutant class** | none needed — the baseline gate is the mechanism, and it is the `blind`-lane pattern already required by Amendment A2 |
| **Fix commit** | this one |

**Symptom.** `make cpp-mutants` reported `INVALID — the unpatched tree does not pass lane "cpp-ci"`,
with the vendored-tree check inside the scratch copy computing a different tree hash and counting
247 files where the working tree has 250.

**Root cause.** `copy_tree` excluded VCS metadata with `tar --exclude=./.git --exclude=./.github`.
bsdtar matches an exclude pattern against any suffix of a stored path, not only against the root, so
`./.github` also matched `./third_party/googletest/.github` — three files that upstream tracks.
The scratch tree was therefore not the tree under test.

**Why it was caught here.** Only because a vendored dependency with its own `.github` directory
arrived in the same step as the lane, and only because the vendored-tree hash check runs inside the
copy rather than only in the working tree. Without that check the copy would have been wrong and
every mutant result would have been about a slightly different tree, indefinitely and invisibly.

**What this would have caused.** Mutant verdicts computed against a tree that is not the repository.
For BM21 the three missing files are inert, so the verdict would have been right by luck; nothing
about the mechanism guarantees the next one would be.

**Fix.** Copy everything, then delete the root paths by name. A glob that "usually" anchors is not an
anchor. Recorded at the call site, because the next person to add an exclusion needs the reason.

### HARNESS-002 — `cpp-ci` passed under network isolation because its build directory was warm

| field | value |
|---|---|
| **Found by** | mutant `BM21-network-in-build` |
| **Phase** | B1.0 |
| **Reproduce** | apply `engine-cpp/mutants/BM21-network-in-build.patch`, run `make cpp-lane-set` (network available), then `make cpp-ci`. Before the fix: green |
| **Invariant that caught it** | no lane touches the network (DESIGN-B1 §9.2) |
| **Mutant class** | `BM21-network-in-build` — it existed, it fired, and the lane was wrong rather than the mutant |
| **Fix commit** | this one |

**Symptom.** `make cpp-mutants` reported `ALIVE  BM21-network-in-build: cpp-ci stayed green`.

**Root cause.** `cpp-ci` reused `engine-cpp/build`. CMake's `FetchContent` populates at configure time
and skips the download when `_deps/` is already populated, so any earlier networked build left behind
exactly the artifact that makes a network dependency invisible. The lane's premise — that a clean
clone with no network can build — was true only when the build directory happened to be cold.

**Why it was caught here.** Because BM21 is bidirectional by construction: the same patched tree must
go green with a network and red without. The control direction ran first, warmed the cache, and the
covering direction then measured the cache instead of the network. Two bugs met — one in the lane,
one in the mutation harness sharing a tree between directions — and the mutant surviving was the only
signal either produced.

**What this would have caused.** `cpp-ci` reporting that no lane touches the network while a lane
touched the network. The failure would surface for the first time in the hands of the stranger the
lane exists to protect: a clean clone, offline, one script, red.

**Fix.** Two, because there were two defects. `cpp-ci` now builds in its own directory and deletes it
first, so the lane is cold by construction rather than by habit. And `cpp-mutants` gives each
direction of a mutant its own tree, because a control run and a covering run are independent
experiments and one must not be able to feed the other.
