# BUGS.md

Every bug caught by the simulator, the crash-consistency rig, or differential testing gets an entry
here. This file is the proof behind the verification claim: it is the difference between "we ran a
lot of tests" and "we can show you what the tests found and why they found it."

**Rules**

1. Every bug found by a checker gets an entry. No exceptions for embarrassing ones — especially not
   for embarrassing ones.
2. Every entry must be reproducible: a seed (at the commit that contained the bug) **and** a plan
   bundle in `seeds/` (reproducible at any commit).
3. Every entry must answer **"which mutant class would have caught this?"** If none would have, a new
   mutant is added to `sim/toy/mutants` **in the same PR as the fix** — not as a follow-up.
   *(CLAUDE.md Amendment A2.)*
4. A bug that a checker did *not* catch — found by inspection, by a real-mode run, or by luck — is
   the most valuable entry in the file. It must additionally record what checker was missing and
   whether one was added.

**Counts:** 0 entries. *(A0 is in progress; the phase gate for A1 requires this file to be nonempty,
because a harness that finds nothing is a harness that is too weak.)*

### BUG-NNN — <one-line symptom, in the voice of what an operator would see>

| field | value |
|---|---|
| **Found by** | sim / crash rig / differential / real-mode chaos / inspection |
| **Phase** | A1 |
| **Reproduce (seed)** | `simctl replay 8834127` at commit `<sha>` |
| **Reproduce (plan)** | `simctl run --plan seeds/BUG-NNN/plan.json` (any commit) |
| **Invariant that caught it** | e.g. Election Safety |
| **Mutant class** | e.g. `M2-ack-before-replicate`; or "none existed — added `M8-…` in this PR" |
| **Fix commit** | `<sha>` |
| **Minimized?** | yes — N fault entries, M ops, K nodes |

**Symptom.** What the checker reported, verbatim where possible.

**Root cause.** The actual mechanism, not the patch. Written so someone who has never seen this code
can follow it.

**Why the checkers caught it here and not earlier.** Which injector had to fire, in what order.

**What this would have caused in production.** Be concrete and be honest: silent data loss, a stalled
range, a lost acknowledged write, a duplicated transfer. If the answer is "nothing user-visible," say
that.

**Fix.** What changed and why that is the right fix rather than a narrower one that would also make
the seed pass.
